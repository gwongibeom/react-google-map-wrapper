`react-google-map-wrapper` is a simple component library for rendering Google Maps in React.

To use `react-google-map-wrapper`, you need a Gooel Maps API key. (if you don't have API key, check <a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>this page</a>)

It aims to componentize all the features of the <a href='https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>Google Maps API</a> and most of them are already componentized. You can also create your own components based on `react-google-map-wrapper` to use Google Maps API as needed.
